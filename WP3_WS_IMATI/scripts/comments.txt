Async training
------------------

This folder contains scripts that will be used as an example for an asynchronous service in CloudFlow.

All scripts should be in "/usr/local/bin/" directory on both machines-
 
All temporary files for result and status are stored in "/tmp/$service_id/" on both machines.

Machine with Glassfish server
    - asyncStarter.sh: /usr/local/bin/asyncStarter.sh
	Input: see launchRemote.sh
	Simply just calls launchRemote.sh with all inputs and redirects its output

    - launchRemote.sh: /usr/local/bin/launchRemote.sh
	Input:	- session_id: keystone token
		- service_id: From WFM
		- status_file: Status file name (Typically "status.txt")
		- result_file_name: result file name (Typically "result.txt")
		- file_to_upload: local file name for file that should be uploaded at the end.
		- gss_output_folder: the folder where to upload the async result
	Creates a folder on tmp for local and remote and sets up and start a remote job (asyncSleeper on compute)

    - remoteCopying.sh:
	Input: 	- fileToCopy
	Copies the file from remote server (compute) to local (glassfish).

Compute machine:
    - /usr/local/bin/asyncSleeper.sh
	Input:	- sessionID: keystone token
		- statusFile: File to print the status
		- fileToUpload: The final result file that will be uploaded to GSS
		- resultFile: for writing the final gss url for the result
		- gssOutputFolder: folder name that should be used in GSS
	DOES NOT PRINT 100! Glassfish machine needs to copy the result file first before printing 100

    - /usr/local/bin/upload_gss.sh
	Input:  - url: GSS file identifier
		- filenameIn: File to upload to GSS
		- sessionToken: keystone token
